## Readings

The two required purchases (described in [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/)) are:

- *Spiegelhalter* which refers to *The Art of Statistics* by David Spiegelhalter
- *Leek* which refers to *The Elements of Data Analytic Style* by Jeffrey Leek

Please feel free to read ahead of our suggested pace in the Calendar below. Note that the *Leek* book is much shorter than the *Spiegelhalter*.

In addition, we also **strongly** encourage you to read [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). 

- We suggest reading things that interest you from the Explore section (chapters 1-8) and the Communicate section (chapters 26-28, in particular) before Project A.
- We suggest adding in some of the Wrangle section (particularly chapters 9-12, 15 and 16) and the rest of the Communicate section before Project B.
